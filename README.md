#### <a name="queues"></a>Queues & Testing
* Implementation of a Queue ADT over a linkedlist data structure. 
[Code](<https://github.com/andrewmahoneyf/Data-Structures-Algorithms/tree/master/Queues%20%26%20Testing/src>)

#### <a name="heap"></a>Heap
* Implementation of the Priority Queue ADT (represented by the PriorityQueue.javainterface). Created own BinaryHeap class that
implements PriorityQueue.  
[Code](<https://github.com/andrewmahoneyf/Data-Structures-Algorithms/tree/master/Heap/src>)

#### <a name="dictionary-adt"></a>Dictionary ADT
*  Implementation of the Dictionary ADT (represented by the Dictionary.javainterface). Created five separate implementations that use the interface: unsorted linked list, unsorted array, sorted linked list, sorted array and binary search tree.
[Code](<https://github.com/andrewmahoneyf/Data-Structures-Algorithms/tree/master/Dictionary%20ADT/src>)

#### <a name="graph"></a>Graph
*  Developed a graph representation.
[Code](<https://github.com/andrewmahoneyf/Data-Structures-Algorithms/tree/master/Graph/src>)

#### <a name="dijkstra"></a>Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Used graph representation from previous assignment to implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding shortest paths.
[Code](<https://github.com/andrewmahoneyf/Data-Structures-Algorithms/tree/master/Dijkstra's%20Algorithm/src>)

#### <a name="avl"></a>AVL
*  Implementation of an AVL tree.
[Code](<https://github.com/andrewmahoneyf/Data-Structures-Algorithms/tree/master/AVL/src>)

#### <a name="final"></a>Final
*  Used comparison sorting to unscramble pieces of images downloaded from a remote server. Compared the performance of two sorting algorithms, SelectionSort and MergeSort. First implemented the sorting algorithms for Integers. Once the sorts worked with integers, implemented both sorts for the Packet class provided.
